# fillit_bitfield
Optimized version of fillit project

My program "fillit" takes a file as an parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and
arranges them in order to create the smallest square possible.

The main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite
an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
